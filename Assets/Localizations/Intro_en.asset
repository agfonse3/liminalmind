    m_Localized: "It wasn't a mistake.  It couldn't have been just that.\r\n\r\nOn
      my way to work, I pressed the wrong numbers. I know I did. \n\nBut this...
      this isn't the same building. \n\nIt's not the same reality.\r\n\r\nThe walls
      don't look the same. \n\nThe light flickers like an irregular heartbeat, and
      the elevator... refuses to open its doors. \n\nTime no longer passes; it simply
      weighs.\r\n\r\nEach floor I visit is a sick fragment of something I don\u2019t
      want to remember. \nFamiliar objects, distorted. Spaces I once inhabited, now
      corrupted by a twisted logic.\r\n\r\nI'm not alone. But I\u2019m not accompanied
      either.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something here... \n\nsomething that feeds on fear.
      \n\nIt doesn\u2019t want to kill me. It wants to break me.... \n\nIt wants
      me to give up.\r\n\r\nBut I won\u2019t. Not this time.\r\n\r\nIf this place
      is a reflection of my mind... \n\nthen maybe, just maybe, I\u2019ll find the
      way out by facing what I never had the courage to look at. \n\nAnd this time...
      \n\nI won\u2019t look away.\r\n"
